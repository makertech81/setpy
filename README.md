# setpy
A python library for data scientists, researchers,  and hobbyists alike to sort through, manipulate, and extract data from datasets.

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.6

## Installation
[setpy](https://pypi.org/project/setpy/) can be installed via [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/setpy/) or [Github](https://github.com/makertech81/setpy).  

### Install via PyPi
```
$ pip3 install setpy
```

### Install via Github (the source)
```
$ python3 setup.py install
```

## Basic Usage
To start a basic project in Python using SetPy import the spmean class as shown (currently the only functionality available):
```python
from setpy import spmean

# First set the directory where your dataset files in txt format are. Include a backslash at the end.

directory_str = "datasets/"

# Create an spmean() class object with the directory as the constructor parameter.

spm = spmean(directory_str)

# Use the function dataMean() to calculate the mean of a certain column of data within as many dates as needed. Each set of dates are recorded as a seperate period.

covidArr = spm.dataMean("01/08/2020", "03/12/2020", "03/13/2020", "04/13/2020")

```

Still a in progress! Check back later for more.

## Limitations of Project
This project is fairly beginner, but in the future Iâ€™d love for this project to grow into way for and be a mainstream tool for and one doing research projects or working with datasets.  This will hopefully be even more flexible and dynamic in the future.

For now, open up an issue stating any interest, ideas, questions, or feedback.
